* The scripts below should be ran to pre-process a number of files 
  * `generate_norm_bw.sh` provides examples of how to generate the normalized bigWigs used to generate the figures, including depth-normalized bigWigs <code>.cpm.bw</code> and input-normalized bigWigs <code>.input_normalized.log2cpm.bw</code>. Furthermore, it provides an example of how replicates (in bigWig format) were merged.
* Certain figures as generated here will largely resemble but are not exactly the same as ones included in the manuscript, as those have had additional manual aesthetic adjustments. Additionally, some minor discrepancies may arise due to a degree of stochasticity in particular algorithms, but they do not impact the conclusions presented
